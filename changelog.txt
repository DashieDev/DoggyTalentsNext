    + The Dog will stop swimming and float as usual when near land, this allows the Dog to smoothly transform 
    between walking and swimming
    / TODO FIX : Upon transition, the Dog may jump up higher than usual. 
  # Modify Hunger Mechanic:
    + When a Dog is hungry (isLowHunger() -> true) he will come near his owner, whine (ask for food) and tit his head while
    stay there for a few seconds, his movement speed will also drastically drecease.
    + When a Dog is zero hunger, depending on the difficulty, certain things may happen :
      + PEACEFUL : Nothing happens
      + EASY : He will gradually take damage, but stops at 1 HP
      + NORMAL : He will take damage faster than the preceeding
      + HARD : He will quickly take damage and may starve to death.
  # Modifying Attacking Mechanic :
  / Two files are involved : DogLeapAtTargetGoal, Dog::getMaxFallDistance and DogMeleeAttackGoal
    + Ajust Dog leaping threashold to make the attack as acurrate as possible while
    still make the Dog sometimes leap. Make the Dog think before jumping to execute the jump as safe as possible. 
    + Adjust the Dog attack goal to efficently attack with safety in mind
