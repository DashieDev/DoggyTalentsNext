v1.3.0beta - 17th November 2022
/Make the Mining Cautious Logic make more sense : 
    / @Credit idea thanks to Sophisticated Wolves from NightKosh
    The dog only go into the mode when owner did a swing with DiggerItem in hand 
    and remains in the mode for 30 seconds more when the owner 
    no longer swinging with DiggerItem in hand.
/Heel by name:
    + Add the option to make the dog sit upon heel completion. Can be achieved by Shift+Enter 
    finishing the command.
/Creeper Sweeper Talent:
    + Make them also growl when a creeper is nearby while sitting on player's head. this
    allow utilization of the feature to better alert creeper.
/Whistle Mode Picking Interface:
    - remove the old Shift+Click Cycling style, the method has proven itself to be relatively
    annoying and unintuitive, by allowing a great chance of accidental mode switch and trigger.
    + Instead the user will be presented with a Screen for them to choose the mode, they can quickly
    pick the mode through the screen via either searching then pressing enter, using the up and arrow 
    key to choose the mode then pressing enter or pressing the corresponding number key. This minimize
    accidental switch because the player doesn't change the mode immediately when shift+click.
+ Add Dog Eating Effect : Eating now makes sound and particles.
+ Increase FindWaterGoal speed to 1.5 for practical reasons.
*BUG FIX : fix SwimmerDog occasionally become uninterative with a bouncing effect upon switching back to land
this bug is created by the MoveControl for Swimming is not properly reset upon transition, this make the 
dog's yya occasionally goes larger than 0.2 on land which cause the dog to always move up
while being canceled by gravity, which cause a side effect that the dog is never on land, which 
prevents path updates. This has been fixed by properly reseting the old moveControl before setting new one.
/Rescue Dog Talent :
    / Limit the heal radius and check if the dog can see the heal target.
    + Rescue Dogs now also heals other Dogs and Wolves of the same owner, with each heal session costs 20
    Hunger.
    + Rescue Dogs now move to the target (Owner or dogs and wolves of the same owner) when low on health
    (health <= 8.0) and then heals when in radius. 
    + Rescues Dogs also check if they can afford to heal the target (hunger - healCost >= 10)
    before actually moving to them. If they can't then the dog will not proceed to go and heal the target.
    in radius 
+ Dogs now eats from nearby ChestDog who are storing food when hunger is lower than 50.
    + They will also move to the ChestDog and eat only when in radius.

    instead of the real hunger value.
    + If health < maxHealth : The dog will heal 1 health each 0.5s interval
    with the cost of 3 saturation hunger per health.
    NOTICE : The dog hunger value still caps at

  your dog "Doggy Armor", unlike other levels the max level for this talent is 3.
  + You then right click the dog with any ArmorItems in hand and a GUI will open letting
  you place or remove any vanilla armor on dog anytime.
  + The dog will actually equip the armor, in other words, the armors is now fully

    growl to warn the owner if danger is

  This talent allows your dog to store water. When you, your other wolves or dogs is on 
  fire, he will run to each and shake his fur, reduce the burning time or completely 
  extinguish you. The higher the level, the more water the dog can store, 
  so as the burning time the dog can reduce! You can either use a water bucket

  on the dog while holding shift.

Change with respect to the Armored Paw Drop
======================================================
Integrate Offical Wolf Variants for DTN Dogs:
+ Each dog will now be one of the Offical Variants released:
[Pale, Chestnut, Striped, Rusty, Woods, Ashen, Snowy, Spotted, Black]
+ The Variant system implemented on the Dog will be independent from the Skin 
system. The corresponding texture of the variant the dog is will
be rendered instead of the usual Pale skin when custom skins are not used, in other
words, when the dog use the "Classical" skin or using a Missing skin, or when player forced
always_render_classical=true in config.
+ The Variant will be shown in the Dog Info GUI regardless if the Dog have Custom Skin on or not.
+ (Configurable) Dog summoned from Doggy Charm will be a random variant instead of just being Pale.

Integrate Wolf Armor for DTN Dogs (1.20.5+) 
+ DTN Dogs can wear Wolf Armors, the procedure is reflected from vanilla:
 Right-Click with a Wolf Armor to equip it on the Dog.
 Right-Click with a Armadillo Scute to repair the Wolf Armor that the Dog is wearing.
 Right-Click with a Shear to remove the Wolf Armor from the Dog if wearing any.
 Dog can also wear Dyed Wolf Armor.
+ The Wolf Armor System is seperated and independent from the current Dog Armor System
meaning, it is more related to the Accessory System (which is also indepedent of), meaning that
this won't conflict with Doggy Armor or the Accessories. The Dog (as current) can wear BOTH
Wolf Armor AND Dog Armor (Player Armor + Doggy Armor) but the Dog Armor will not take effect when
when the incoming damage is absorbed by the Wolf Armor.
+ The Wolf Armor also count towards the Dog "Nakey-ness"
+ Beside the vanilla way, player can also Equip/Remove the Wolf Armor of the Dog via its
Dog Accessory GUI like one may do when adding/removing Accessories.
+ When a Dog is wearing Wolf Armor, the health shown in the Dog Info GUI will be
[The dog remaining HP]+[Wolf Armor durability left]

When a Vanilla Wolf is trained into DTN Wolf:  
+ It retains its variant.
+ It retains its Wolf Armor if wearing any. (1.20.5+)
+ It's Thick Collar will also be retained instead of the usual thin one. (1.20.5+)
======================================================

Push Resisting mechanic Overhaul
======================================================
+ Instead of forcing Zero delta Movement, the move speed will be capped
at a magnitude when Dog is idle resisting push
+ Dog won't resist push while is actually in hurting zone (ex: In lava itself)
allowing players to push Dog out. Dog will continue to not resist for 1s 
after being out of hurting area.
======================================================

Ranged Attack Mechanic for dogs
======================================================
+ Dog can now carry out Ranged Attack aside Melee Attack.
+ Currently, this behaviour is available via the Doggy Tools Talents
where if a Dog is holding a Bow with any Arrows in its Hotbar OR Pack Puppy Inventory,
it will switch to Ranged Attack mode, and utilize the Bow to carry out the attack.
======================================================

+ Dog Greeting Owners now also play a Cute Greet Anim while jumping around the Owner.
+ Tune Greeting Owner Anim/Jump frequency.
New advancements
======================================================
+ "Don't Worry! It's Sterile." - Apply a Bandage on an Injured Dog.
+ "A Full Recovery!" - Aid an Injured Dog to recover.
+ "The Best Dog-tor!" - Aid an Injured Dog to recover in the Best Condition.
======================================================

# Remove Cut-Corner mechanic for Dogs.
 According to analysis and also the fact that the Dog hitbox width was never intended to exceed
1 block in the first place, the Cut Corner mechanic is now redundant and as observed, is the 
cause of some incident when the Dog trips and fall when doing sharp turn.
This significantly improve the Dog pathfinding reliablity with minimal side effect.
# Remove Nutrition Limit when feeding Dog Meat food, allowing dogs to eat certain Meat food again
Rotten Flesh however, is strictly prohibited.
# The Tag which shows the Dog's Owner when a player is Sneaking
will no longer shown to the player if he is the Dog's owner.
# Hellhound Max now Immune to Freezing and can Melt Powered Snow.
# Incapacitated Dogs now Whine less when still being gravely injured,
and being completely silent for the rest of the time, additionally the whining volume
is significantly diminished to paint the state where the dog is half-unconcious and being
too weak to do a normal whine. The dog whine frequency and volume will also be increased by a certain
when the Dog is bandaged since it regained conciousness but still in pain.
# Organized DTN Advancements.
# Revert Ammy and Hayabusa Model to Classical Style to be consistent with the rest of the Kusa(s)
and compatible with Wolf Armor.
# Rebrand Incapacitated into Injured.
