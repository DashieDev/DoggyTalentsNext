v1.3.0beta - 17th November 2022
/Make the Mining Cautious Logic make more sense : 
    / @Credit idea thanks to Sophisticated Wolves from NightKosh
    The dog only go into the mode when owner did a swing with DiggerItem in hand 
    and remains in the mode for 30 seconds more when the owner 
    no longer swinging with DiggerItem in hand.
/Heel by name:
    + Add the option to make the dog sit upon heel completion. Can be achieved by Shift+Enter 
    finishing the command.
/Creeper Sweeper Talent:
    + Make them also growl when a creeper is nearby while sitting on player's head. this
    allow utilization of the feature to better alert creeper.
/Whistle Mode Picking Interface:
    - remove the old Shift+Click Cycling style, the method has proven itself to be relatively
    annoying and unintuitive, by allowing a great chance of accidental mode switch and trigger.
    + Instead the user will be presented with a Screen for them to choose the mode, they can quickly
    pick the mode through the screen via either searching then pressing enter, using the up and arrow 
    key to choose the mode then pressing enter or pressing the corresponding number key. This minimize
    accidental switch because the player doesn't change the mode immediately when shift+click.
+ Add Dog Eating Effect : Eating now makes sound and particles.
+ Increase FindWaterGoal speed to 1.5 for practical reasons.
*BUG FIX : fix SwimmerDog occasionally become uninterative with a bouncing effect upon switching back to land
this bug is created by the MoveControl for Swimming is not properly reset upon transition, this make the 
dog's yya occasionally goes larger than 0.2 on land which cause the dog to always move up
while being canceled by gravity, which cause a side effect that the dog is never on land, which 
prevents path updates. This has been fixed by properly reseting the old moveControl before setting new one.
/Rescue Dog Talent :
    / Limit the heal radius and check if the dog can see the heal target.
    + Rescue Dogs now also heals other Dogs and Wolves of the same owner, with each heal session costs 20
    Hunger.
    + Rescue Dogs now move to the target (Owner or dogs and wolves of the same owner) when low on health
    (health <= 8.0) and then heals when in radius. 
    + Rescues Dogs also check if they can afford to heal the target (hunger - healCost >= 10)
    before actually moving to them. If they can't then the dog will not proceed to go and heal the target.
    in radius 
+ Dogs now eats from nearby ChestDog who are storing food when hunger is lower than 50.
    + They will also move to the ChestDog and eat only when in radius.

    instead of the real hunger value.
    + If health < maxHealth : The dog will heal 1 health each 0.5s interval
    with the cost of 3 saturation hunger per health.
    NOTICE : The dog hunger value still caps at
    the real max value.

  your dog "Doggy Armor", unlike other levels the max level for this talent is 3.
  + You then right click the dog with any ArmorItems in hand and a GUI will open letting
  you place or remove any vanilla armor on dog anytime.
  + The dog will actually equip the armor, in other words, the armors is now fully

  This talent allows your dog to store water. When you, your other wolves or dogs is on 
  fire, he will run to each and shake his fur, reduce the burning time or completely 
  extinguish you. The higher the level, the more water the dog can store, 
  so as the burning time the dog can reduce! You can either use a water bucket

  on the dog while holding shift.
