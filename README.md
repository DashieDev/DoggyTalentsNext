#### A Note From DashieDev
 * This project purpose is to continue the developement of the beloved mod **DoggyTalents**, which the current author
 **ProPercivalalb** no longer have the time to work on as he emailed me in a pull request, which is [here](https://github.com/percivalalb/DoggyTalents/pull/402#issuecomment-1152874076).
 * **I DO NOT OWN THE CORE IDEAS** , the original ideas belongs to **RaustBlackDragon** back in 2013, and most of the code is still
 belongs to **ProPercivalalb** 's DoggyTalents2 repository, while i was copying it over, i make some big changes which involves
 upgrading the mod to Minecraft newest version at that time, which is **1.19.2**. 
 * **EVERYTHING ELSE ASIDE, HAVE FUN WITH THE MOD! ‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂ü¶¥‚õèÔ∏èüéπ‚ù§Ô∏è**
