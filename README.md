#### Our Vision
 * Our vision is to make the dogs Harmonize with the player throughout the game, like two hands on the piano, when the two sound come together, it produce a harmony, which is pleasant to the ear, the Player and the Dogs is like the two hands, the dog should be able to be an accompaniment to the player well while not be overpowered in the context, although when on-demand, the Dog can have those abilities, but he should work to get it, and you, the Player, should help training him to achieve the abilities.
