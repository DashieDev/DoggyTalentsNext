If you, your other wolves or Dogs are on fire, it will run to each and shake its fur, reduce the burn time or completely extinguish the target. The higher the level, the more Water the Dog can store, so as the burning time the Dog can reduce! You can either use a Water Bucket on the Dog to replenish Water or the Dog will automatically absorb Water when it comes in contact with Rain or a Water source. You can check the amount of Water left by using any bucket on the Dog while holding Sneak. Mastering the talent grants your Dog's fur Infinite Water Capacity.",
   "talent.doggytalents.doggy_tools.description": "Allows your Dog to utilize certain tools to help you with specific tasks. Tools can be added to the Dog's toolbar, which can be accessed by Right-clicking your Dog with any variants of the pickaxe. The higher the level, the greater the capacity of the toolbar. For example: Dogs with a Hoe inside the toolbar with either Wheat Seeds or Rice Grains will help you harvest Wheat and Rice respectively (if both is present in the Dog's hotbar, it will choose the nearest one from the left). When attacking, Dogs with any weapon in their toolbar will find and equip the closest weapon from the left.",

   "talent.doggytalents.chemi_canine.description": "When you or your other dogs receive negative effects, the dog with this talent will run to the target and try to absorb the negative effects, one at a time. The effects will accumulate to the dogs (without causing harm to it). When it accumulates enough, the dog cannot absorb more effects and have to wait for the accumulated effects to decay, which will take a while. However, when the dog attacks, the target will be affected by one of the effects absorbed by it, which also consumes the effect allowing the dog to absorb again.",

Each level increases your dog's sniffing distance, thus increasing the chance of finding the desired ore. To make your dog start detecting a certain block, a Scent Treat is required to mark the scent of the block. The treat then be given to the dog who will lick the treat, memorize the scent and give you back. To make your dog stop detecting, give it a Empty Scent Treat. To check which block your Dog are looking for, Sneak and Right-Click it with any Scent Treat in hand. One thing to note is that Dogs are not quite good at detecting blocks vertically, so despite the radius increase that each level provides along the horizontal plane, they are only capable of locating blocks which is not around 3 blocks higher or lower than where they are standing. Be sure to pay close attention to what the Dog is trying to tell you to have a better idea of where the block is.",
