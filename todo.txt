DoggyTalents Update Check

Make dog heal a certain amount of health when full hunger like player
But occasionally recieve an effect where he cannot heal and need rest.

Maybe consider building a Talent Bus so that Talents can communicate better with each other.
When a dog is hungry he will emit an event on the bus telling that he is hungry 
And the ChestDog With food nearby will listen to the event, and if there is meat,
they will respond to the bus telling that they have the meat making them a eligable target
And the dog will acknowleage and move to the ChestDog.
Make dog tail angle = 1.72 - lostHealth*(ratio) where ratio = HALF_PI/maxHealth and will
recalc when there is change, the check interval is 1 per tick

         * first register a goal here called TalentActionGoal
         * which have a fixed priority and LOOK/MOVE/JUMP lock 
         * that when run, set a field
         * of the dog called TalentActionReady to true
         * then add another goalSelector to the dog called
         * the talentActionSelector and call its tick() in aiStep()
         * only when TalentActionReady Maybe another Mechanic that allows
         * more practical priority group like LOW MEDIUM HIGH
         * Dog can only execute 1 action at a time and will queue the other action
         * Right now the easy way is to have all of the goal at the same priority 
         * at each group ...
